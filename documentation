3. challenges while deveopment
    - I struggled with authentication.
        I checked clientId and clientSecret for several times and tested. 
        But it always gave me 403 error.
        After that I tested on postman, and it worked.
        Finally, I noticed there was a problem with Agent code in header.
        First I tried with the same agent as postman, after that I replaced it with my app name and username.
    - I wasted good amount of time while debugging was not working well.
        The reason was when I debug, the app looked appsettings.json in debug folder, that's why it couldn't get the information from appsettings.json.
        Finally, I found the solution to insert the code in RedditStatsTracker.csproj to copy appsettings.json file to any output folder.
